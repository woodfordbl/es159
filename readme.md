## Project Description

This is a repository for the ES159 class at Harvard SEAS. It contains several lab components that are used to demonstrate various ways to abstract a multi axis robot into various representations include Denavit Hartenberg and Screw Axis. 

## Usage

To run any one of the labs you will need to pull the file out into the main directory to allow for the appropriate package imports.

## Notes

Please note that Lab3b is incorrect and does not properly calculate the M_i_i-1 matrices within the idynamics. This will have to be debugged throughout.

## Inspiration

The structure for several of these files similarly follows Robotics Toolbox for Python which is a much deeper and more applicable repository. I chose to build these labs out in Python in order to better lear object oriented programming and this was a good excuse for it.
